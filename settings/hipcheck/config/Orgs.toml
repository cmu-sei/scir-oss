# Orgs.toml
#
# This configuration file defines the set of organizations against which
# affiliation may be checked for committers and authors in a repository,
# and how that affiliation determination will be made (the "strategy").
###############################################################################


#==============================================================================
# Strategy
#
# This section defines one of two forms of a strategy, either a single string
# representing the mode (which may be "independent", "affiliated", "all", or
# "none"), or a mode and a list of references (either "country:<country_name>"
# or "org:<org_name>"). Together, these define the list of organizations to be
# considered for matching, and whether to flag identities as concerning if
# if they're _affiliated_ with an org in the list ("affiliated" mode), or are
# _not affiliated_ with an org in the list ("independent" mode).
#==============================================================================

# The strategy spec can be short, implicitly being affiliated with or
# independent from all the orgs in the file.
#
# strategy = "independent"

# The strategy spec would alternatively look like this.
# With this mode, you can more completely specify the orgs or countries
# to include in the list, and mark whether we're rejecting those affiliated
# with or independent from the selected org list.
strategy_spec = { mode = "affiliated", list = ["country:China"] }


#==============================================================================
# Orgs
#
# This section defines a list of organizations, including their name, primary
# affiliated country, and any email hosts known to be connected to them.
